## Project 3 - Cam

We developed a 3D interface for the game Cam developed for another curricular unity (PLOG), available [here](https://github.com/helenaMontenegro/PLOG-18-19).

We has two different scenarios for the game:

There are the following game modes: *PC vs PC*, *Player vs PC* and *Player vs Player*. The user can click either on the pieces or the cells to select a piece to be moved and the place to where it should be moved. The user can also undo his last movement.
